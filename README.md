# Charity_Data_Neural_Network

**Overview:** The purpose of this analysis is to find predict whether or not the Non-Profit organization would be successful in gaining the necessary funds.

**Results:** 

*Data Preprocessing*

  - What variable(s) are the target(s) (y) for your model?
    - Application type, Affiliation, Classification, Use case, income amount
  - What variable(s) are the features (X) for your model?
    - If the charity was successful in obtaining funding
  - What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
    - EIN, Organization, Status, Special Considerations, Ask Amount

*Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model*

  - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    - 2 layers, 3 Activation functions (Relu & Sigmund) 
  - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    - No, it was just below it at 74.3%
  - What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
    - Change the amount of layers, change the variables that were removed, and changed the amount of information we were using 

**Summary:**
